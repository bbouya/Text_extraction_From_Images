In this project, we will be working on extracting text from images, After extracting
the text we will apply some basic functions of OPENCV on that text to enhance it and to get more 
accurate results. this project will be very useful as it will save Time and effort of typing from 
an imagesss

The steps to folow:
1. Dawnloading the Tesseract and Install itn with other Dependencies
2. Loading The image for text extraction, Resizing it, And Then save it.
3. Using pytersseract to extracte the text from the image.
4. Processing the Text extracted from the images
5. Using computer vision for further preprocessing of complex images
6. Removing noise from the image using the blur functtion 
7. Perform threshold transforamtion of the image.
8. Using erode function of cv2 on image
9. performing some other image preprocessing operations.
10. Drawing rectangles around a character and a particular pattern/word
